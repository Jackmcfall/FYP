## The Impact COVID-19 had on Home Advantage in Professional Football: Serie A

## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the landscape of sports, with football experiencing unparalleled disruptions. This research paper seeks to explore the potential impact of the pandemic on home advantage in Serie A, Italy's premier football league. By analysing data from pre-pandemic, mid-pandemic and post-pandemic seasons, the study aims to assess changes in the dynamics of home advantage during this unprecedented period. The research investigates possible factors contributing to any observed changes in home advantage, including the absence or reduced number of fans in stadiums, strict health and safety protocols, and alterations in players' mental and physical states. This exploration of the home advantage effect during the pandemic provides insights into the complex interplay of psychological and environmental factors influencing team performance in football. Moreover, the study highlights the potential significance of fan presence in shaping competitive outcomes and discusses the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term trends in home advantage across various sports. We measure this home advantage by scraping data from various websites in order to create our own database for our statistical analysis. Different variables must be accounted for during this analysis, while also fitting models with this database that we have constructed. This paper ultimately conducts research on whether the COVID-19 pandemic truly had an impact on home advantage in the Serie A.
